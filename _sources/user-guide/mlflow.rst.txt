MLFlow
======

This tutorial will guide you through the integration of MLFlow with Kubeflow using `Juju <https://juju.is/>`_ with `Microk8s <https://microk8s.io/>`_. This integration enables true automated model lifecycle management using MLFlow metrics and the MLFlow model registry.

`MLFlow <https://www.mlflow.org/>`_ is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

MLflow-Kubeflow integration requires a relation between MLflow and `MinIO <https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html>`_ operator, that you will learn more about in the guide. MinIO is used to store artifacts produced by MLflow runs (files, models, images, in-memory objects, model summary, etc). In the last section of this tutorial, you’ll learn how to access the artifact store using MinIO client or boto3 APIs.

Prerequisites
=============

* You have already installed Kubeflow on your cluster (full or lite version).
* You can access the kubeflow dashboard.

Get Started with MLFlow - Charmed Kubeflow integration
======================================================

Deploy mlflow-server and mlflow-db
----------------------------------

In an Ubuntu terminal window, run the following commands to deploy ``mlflow-server`` and ``mlflow-db``.

.. code-block:: shell

    juju deploy mlflow-server
    juju deploy charmed-osm-mariadb-k8s mlflow-db

Run ``watch juju status`` to watch the application status of ``mlflow-db`` become active and ``mlflow-server`` to be waiting for ``mysql`` relation data. This takes about a minute.


Add the relations between components
------------------------------------

For ``mlflow-server`` to become active, you need to integrate applications that have been deployed with these commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    juju relate minio mlflow-server
    juju relate istio-pilot mlflow-server
    juju relate mlflow-db mlflow-server
    juju relate mlflow-server admission-webhook


Run ``watch juju status --relations`` to see the relations you created. Relations are created almost immediately. You should then wait a few minutes for the ``mlflow-server`` unit to have active status so you can access the dashboard next.


Access the Dashboard
--------------------

If you followed the previous steps to deploy MLFlow with Kubeflow, you could access the dashboard by going to `http://10.64.140.43.nip.io/mlflow/#/ <http://10.64.140.43.nip.io/mlflow/#/>`_

Otherwise, run ``microk8s kubectl get services -A | grep "mlflow-server"``, and open the MLFlow ClusterIP in the browser with ``:5000`` on the end.

Run an example model with Kubeflow
==================================

.. note::
    **Temporary workaround for missing pod-defaults**
    Run the following command to make a copy of pod defaults to the user’s namespace, which is ``admin`` following the guide.
    ``microk8s kubectl get poddefaults mlflow-server-minio -o yaml -n kubeflow | sed 's/namespace: kubeflow/namespace: admin/' | microk8s kubectl create -f -``

Open the Kubeflow dashboard by going to `http://10.64.140.43.nip.io/ <http://10.64.140.43.nip.io/>`_ and log in with the username and password .

Create a new Notebook Server, taking care to specify the ``mlflow-server-minio`` configuration, by ticking the box next to it. This will ensure that the correct environment variables are set so that the MLflow SDK can connect to the MLflow server.

.. image:: ../_static/user-guide-mlflow-config.png

For an example code, upload or paste the `Elastic Net wine model notebook <https://github.com/canonical/mlflow-operator/blob/main/examples/elastic_net_wine_model.ipynb>`_ to the Notebook server.

Run the first two cells and observe that your model metrics are recorded in MLflow as shown in the cell output below. You can see the RMSE, MAE, and R2 for the run model.

.. image:: ../_static/user-guide-mlflow-notebook01.png

Run the third cell to view a list of files in the object storage.

.. image:: ../_static/user-guide-mlflow-notebook02.png

In the last cell, replace ``<minio file path>`` with the path of the file you want to download. Use the object path listed in the output of the previous cell, and replace ``<notebook server file path>`` with the desired destination file for the downloaded object.

For example, to download ``requirements.txt`` listed in the above screenshot, run ``object_storage.download_file(default_bucket_name,'0/10e3bd4d7edd4b879b239a96cb300d48/artifacts/model/requirements.txt','requirements.txt')``

The downloaded object will show up in the file browser on the left.

Access Artifacts
================

Based on the setup in the Get Started section, artifacts are stored in MinIO. Artifacts include output files recorded by MLflow runs in any format such as models, data files, and images.

You could access the artifacts using the MinIO client or boto3 with python.

Get MinIO access and secret key
-------------------------------

To access the artifacts, you first need to get MinIO access and secret key for authentication.

* Find admission webhook unit’s name

.. code-block:: shell

    juju status | grep admission-webhook/

* copy the unit’s name to use it in the next command

* Run the command below to get MinIO ``envs``

.. code-block:: shell

    juju show-unit <admission webhook unit name> | yq .admission-webhook/*.relation-info[0].application-data

The expected results will look similar to the one below. Save your ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` as you will need them in the next part to use MinIO client.

.. code-block:: shell 

    pod-defaults: '{"minio": {"env": {"AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "some id", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "some secret key", "MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL": "http://minio.kubeflow:9000", "MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI": "http://mlflow-server.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:5000"}}}'

.. note::
    
    The environment variables would be the same even if MinIO is not on AWS, it’s based on MinIO’s configuration not the cloud provider.


MinIO client
------------

Install MinIO client following the `official guide <https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html?ref=docs-redirect>`_.

After that set alias for the MinIO.

.. code-block:: shell

    mc alias set <alias> http://`juju status --format yaml | yq .applications.minio.units.minio/*.address`:9000 $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

* List content in the default Mlflow bucket. This will show the files recorded by your MLflow run done in the previous section.

.. code-block:: shell

    mc ls <alias>/mlflow

* Read the content of a specific file stored in MLFlow during a run.

.. code-block:: shell

    mc cat <alias>/<path to file>


Boto3
-----

Boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python. It provides a Python API to interact with AWS services.

This code is also included in the `example notebook <https://github.com/canonical/mlflow-operator/blob/main/examples/elastic_net_wine_model.ipynb>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    minio = boto3.client(
            "s3",
            endpoint_url=os.getenv("MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL"),
            config=boto3.session.Config(signature_version="s3v4"),
        )

.. note::
    
    If you are accessing the bucket outside of a Kubeflow Notebook server, replace the os ``env`` with ``MinIOunit`` IP, with ``:9000`` at the end.

Run this in the terminal to get the IP:

.. code-block:: shell

    echo http://`juju status --format yaml | yq .applications.minio.units.minio/*.address`:9000

To list files in the default bucket ``mlflow``:

.. code-block:: python

    response = minio.list_objects_v2(Bucket="mlflow")

    files = response.get("Contents")

    for file in files:

        print(f"file_name: {file['Key']}, size: {file['Size']}")

To download a specific file:

.. code-block:: python

    minio.download_file(default_bucket_name,'&lt;minio file path>', '&lt;notebook server file path>')

For more information, see `Boto3 docs <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html>`_.
